Infection Map - Knowledge from the crowds and the sky
=====================================================

Infection Map is a web service that allows to collect and study the evolution of diseases.

IM relies on two mechanisms:

  * Collecting disease information directly from people, by an attempt to make it easy to report a disease occurence.
  * Linking collected data with satellite data on weather conditions related to the disease (e.g. precipitations).

Status
------

  * IM can collect disease information.
  * Satellite data is still in the workings at this point. Data from Shizuku is the target for ISAC 2015.
  * Focus on types of influenza and the Dengue fever.
